       "writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill . \n",

       "whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue , terrible overacting , and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury , signifying nothing . \n",
       "the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is : \" i hate that mouse \" . \n",

       "he jumps into a tiny bed , pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep , seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone . \n",
       "it's a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film . \n",
